      I followed a dual-master programme, with half of my courses in Delft for my master in Aerospace Engineering.
      My focus in Delft was two-fold. 
      Firstly, I deepened my knowledge towards wind-turbines -- learning about experimental simulations and flow measurement techniques, and diving into rotor/wake aerodynamics and aeroelasticity.
      Second, I learned more general optimisation techniques, both algorithmic, and deep-learning in nature.
      <br><br>
      I thoroughly enjoyed my master and had found my stride, as exemplified by the Honors I received during graduation.
      <br><br>
      Full list of courses: Research Methodologies; Experimental Simulations; Rotor / wake Aerodynamics; Flow Measurement Techniques; Bio-inspired Intelligence and learning for Aerospace Applications; Fundamentals of Aero-elasticity; Wind Turbine Design; Wind Turbine Aeroelasticity; Thesis Wind Energy Rotor Design; Engineering Optimisation: Concepts and Applications; Ethics and Engineering for Aerospace Engineering
    skills: [Optimization, Aerodynamics, AI, Python, WTG knowledge]

      As part of my dual-master programme, I spent half of my time in Lyngby towards my master in Wind Turbine Technology.
      During my time in Lyngby, I gained a holistic and pragmatic understanding of wind turbines, wind turbine analytics and the data-analysis side of wind turbines.
      Also diving further into understanding wind, through turbulence theory and micro meteorology. 
      Besides that, I've also studied machine learning and simulation techniques here because the wind-field, as any other these days, is heavily data-driven.

      My bachelors was in Aerospace Engineering, targeted towards air- and spaceflight. 
      I learned about material properties and aerospace design, taking my initial steps towards structural and aerodynamical analysis.
      I also set-up fundamentals in calculus, linear algebra, probabilities, differential equations, and learned to code in both Matlab and Python.

      My minor was in Communication Design for Inovation.
      Wanting to take a break from the hard-core physics and mathematics involved with Aerospace Engineering, I decided to broaden my horizons in communication studies.
      My philosophy was: Whether you're maneging or being managed, it's always good to be able to communicate clearly.
      Here I learned the common hurdles and pit-falls of communication, and became more aware of my own communication strategy and personality within teams.

      While in Denmark, I wrote a master thesis called: Machine learning and image analysis on photos of a solitary tree in a complex background (extraction and analysis of key properties for wind-tree interaction).
      It allowed me to better hone my machine learning skills, and respect the vast number of edge cases that lure within data science.
      The thesis also presented an opportunity for me to improve my image analysis skills.
