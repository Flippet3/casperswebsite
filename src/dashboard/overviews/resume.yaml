      I followed a dual-master programme, with half of my courses in Delft for my master in Aerospace Engineering.
      My focus in Delft was two-fold. 
      Firstly, I deepened my knowledge towards wind-turbines -- learning about experimental simulations and flow measurement techniques, and diving into rotor/wake aerodynamics and aero-elasticity.
      Second, I learned more general optimisation techniques, both algorithmic, and deep-learning in nature.
      <br><br>
      I thoroughly enjoyed my master and had found my stride, as exemplified by the Honors I received during graduation.

      As part of my dual-master programme, I spent half of my time in Lyngby towards my master in Wind Turbine Technology.
      During my time in Lyngby, I gained a holistic and pragmatic understanding of wind turbines, wind turbine analytics and the data-analysis side of wind turbines.
      Also diving further into understanding wind, through turbulence theory and micro meteorology. 
      Besides that, I've also studied machine learning and simulation techniques here because the wind-field, as any other these days, is heavily data-driven.

      My minor was in Communication Design for Innovation.
      Wanting to take a break from the hard-core physics and mathematics involved with Aerospace Engineering, I decided to broaden my horizons in communication studies.
      My philosophy was: Whether you're maneging or being managed, it's always good to be able to communicate clearly.
      Here I learned the common hurdles and pit-falls of communication, and became more aware of my own communication strategy and personality within teams.

      While in Denmark, I wrote a master thesis called: Machine learning and image analysis on photos of a solitary tree in a complex background (extraction and analysis of key properties for wind-tree interaction).
      It allowed me to better hone my machine learning skills, and respect the vast number of edge cases that lure within data science.
      The thesis also presented an opportunity for me to improve my image analysis skills.

      Initially, I was hired in Orsted to streamline the model execution of the Power and Control Optimisation team within the Advanced Analytics department.
      During my onboarding, I became familiar with Azure pipelines and Kubernetes Orchestration (I would later follow a week-long seminar and successfully become a certified kubernetes developer.)
      I worked in an agile team following SAFe methodologies with Azure devops.
      <br><br>
      Aligning with the other teams within the department, I spearheaded a new platform that decoupled data transformation, reporting, and dashboarding. 
      The solutions were built with expandability and scalability in mind, also offering APIs and SDKs for developers to interface smoothly.
      The requirements were stringent as terabytes of turbine data had to be processed daily and continuously.
      <br><br>
      My contribution was most felt in my ability to speak both the language of a data scientist, as well as that of a data engineer -- effectively communication limitations and requirements between both parties.
      I loved being at the end of the value-chain, as it allowed for quick iterations on solutions and was a breeding ground for innovation and creativity.
      One such innovation was an automated reporting tool that would off-load routine tasks from the data-scientists, and streamline the reporting process.
    skills: [ CI/CD, Cloud, Orchestration, Devops, Python, Dashboard, Software architecture, API, SDK, Networking, Data Structure ]

      This was my first post-graduation job at a small company that offered advanced analyses for large turbine owners.
      I was hired because of my programming expertise and my understanding of wind turbines, and my main task was to improve the suite of optimisation models ran at the company.
      I reduced the uncertainty of the models, and spearheaded an analyses towards a case of frequent turbine-generator failures, offering new insights.
      <br><br>
      I was also put in charge of an initiative to run the models live instead of statically -- updating results continuously as data streamed in, and performing automated turbine adjustments using SimuLink.
      <br><br>
      Some ad-hoc tasks that I performed were the unpacking of large binary data dumps to easily accessible and optimized data structures, and creating interactive tools towards mapping out the landscape of wind-farm projects.
    skills: [ Linux, WTG Knowledge, Simulink, Data Structure ]
